# tm
simple cpp countdown timer
# Why? 
Because I'm quite forgetful... I forget just about everything, when working on a project or some stuff at my desk. 
# Use
Simple.. just type tm <Time in minutes>. After the expired time, a dbus notification is shown. See tm --help for more. 
# ToDo: 
- add -t parameter to set time in HH:MIN format 
- For learning reasons: googletest, PKGBUILD, configureskript etc...
